# Plant_Disease_Detection
This is a plant disease detection system made in Deep Learning CNN.
Plant diseases are a major threat to global food security and sustainability. Identification and timely treatment of plant diseases can save crops, reduce costs, and improve yield. However, early detection and diagnosis of plant diseases can be challenging and time-consuming, requiring expert knowledge and experience. Advances in computer vision and machine learning techniques have paved the way for the development of automated systems that can help farmers and plant pathologists to detect plant diseases quickly and accurately.
1.1	Aim
The aim of this project is to develop a plant disease detection system that can identify the presence of diseases in crops using image processing and deep learning techniques. The system will be able to classify images of plants into healthy or diseased categories, and if the plant is diseased, the system will be able to identify the type of disease present.
1.2	Objectives 
The objectives of the project are as follows:
•	To develop an image processing pipeline to pre-process and prepare plant images for analysis.
•	To train a deep learning model to classify plant images into healthy or diseased categories.
•	To extend the deep learning model to identify the type of disease present in diseased plants.
•	To evaluate the performance of the plant disease detection system on a large dataset of plant images.
1.3	Contributions 
The contributions of this project are as follows:
•	Development of a robust image processing pipeline that can handle various types of plant images.
•	Creation of a deep learning model that can accurately classify plant images into healthy or diseased categories.
•	Extension of the deep learning model to identify the type of disease present in diseased plants.
•	Evaluation of the performance of the plant disease detection system on a large dataset of plant images, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential to assist farmers and plant pathologists in the identification and treatment of plant diseases.
